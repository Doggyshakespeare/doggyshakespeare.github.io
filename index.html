    Hi, I'm Doggyshakespeare&mdash;maths, science, analog computational device, and language enthusiast; &tau;-ist; brony; and amateur proofreader/prereader/editor. In different circles I'm perhaps known by different names and for different things, and some these things can be found on this website, navigable by clicking the buttons on the sidebar on the left.
    <br><br>
    SR (Slide rule): Since 2015 I've been working on and off on designing and making my own slide rule, an analog calculator that can calculate most basic functions (though with limited accuracy) and that works just by sliding ruler-like sticks, now at version 3.1. A virtual version is available, and from DL you can download, print, and make your own slide rule, though a tutorial for how to do that will come later (complete: estimated late 2018 or early 2019).
    <br><br>
    ST (Solubility Table): Since 2017 September I've been working on and off on a solubility table, a table that lists solubility values of various salts. Finally in 2018.08.12 the first version was finished, with values for 517 salts. Will be updated in the future.
    <br><br>
    DL (Downloads): Self-explanatory.

    Things I am working on:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Not much at the moment. Maybe a custom homepage and/or some writing next?</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    More content will come in the future.
