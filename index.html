    Hi, I'm Doggyshakespeare&mdash;maths, science, analog computational device, and language enthusiast; &tau;-ist; brony; and amateur proofreader/prereader/editor. In different circles I'm perhaps known by different names and for different things, and some these things can be found on this website, navigable by clicking the buttons on the sidebar on the left.

                SR (Slide rule): Since 2015 I've been working on and off on designing and making my own slide rule, an analog calculator that can calculate most basic functions (though with limited accuracy) and that works just by sliding ruler-like sticks. A virtual version is available, and from DL you can download, print, and make your own slide rule, though a tutorial for how to do that will come later (complete: estimated late 2018 or early 2019).
                <br><br>
                DL (Downloads): Self-explanatory.

                Things I am working on:

                <ul>
                    <li>Solubility chart: chart of solubility values for various salts (progress: 40%; complete: estimated 2018 early August)</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                More content will come in the future.
