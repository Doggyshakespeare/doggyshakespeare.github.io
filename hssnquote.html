    This quote contains two puns and a link&mdash;"lying", "lives", and <a href="https://bit.ly/ingGives-ButAidLives">bit.ly/ingGives-ButAidLives</a> (which links to this page) respectively.
    <br><br>
    The first part, "No bit lying gives", in is OSV (object-subject-verb, i.e. "lying" is the subject, "gives" is the verb, and "No bit" is the object), and has two intended meanings. First, "bit" is a synonym for currency. In the U.S., a bit can mean $1/8, while in the U.K. and in Canada, historically the word also referred to coins. The "bit" is also the name for Equestrian currency. More loosely, though, "bit" also means "a small part", so "no bit" can be interpreted approximately as "nothing".
    <br><br>
    The word "lying" can mean "not telling the truth" as well as "be in a horizontal position". The latter has the connotation of "being lazy" or "doing nothing", as usually when one lies down one is not doing anything. Both are intended meanings of the quote&mdash;"not telling the truth will get you nothing" as well as "not doing anything will get you nothing".
    <br><br>
    Now onto the second part: "but aid lives". There are again two meanings here, with the word "lives". As a verb&mdash;which rhymes with the first part&mdash;, it means "being alive", or more loosely, "will last a long time" (as in "lives on"); as a noun, it means "multiple beings that are alive". With the first meaning, "aid lives" means "help/support will last a long time", while with the second meaning, "aid lives" (where "aid" is a verb) means "help (other) beings". Both are, again, intended, so putting them together yields "the effects of helping others will last a long time".
    <br><br>
    Putting the two parts together, the quote altogether means "<b>not telling the truth and/or not doing anything will get you nothing/nowhere, while the effects of helping others will last a long time/will go a long way</b>".
    <br><br>
    Also, the quote has a hidden link, made possible with the bit.ly link shortener, and so can also be written as "No <a href="https://bit.ly/ingGives-ButAidLives">Bit.Ly/ingGives-ButAidLives</a>", which is also only 30 characters long!
